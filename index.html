        <h1>Introduction to Dogs</h1>
        <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have
            been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.</p>
        <p>Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet
            because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans.</p>

        <h1>Caring for Dogs</h1>
        <p>Taking care of a dog requires providing them with proper nutrition, regular veterinary check-ups, grooming,
            and exercise. Dogs also need love and attention to be happy and well-adjusted pets.</p>

        <h1>Fun Facts About Dogs</h1>
        <p>Dogs have an extraordinary sense of smell and hearing. They can hear sounds at four times the distance that
            humans can.</p>
        <p>Did you know that dogs have three eyelids? The third lid, called a nictitating membrane or "haw," keeps the
            eye protected and lubricated.</p>
